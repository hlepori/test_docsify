The FIXM Release Plan describes the roadmap for the FIXM core releases and for the verified 
extensions  to  FIXM.  It provides information about the overall ICAO Information Management & 
SWIM contexts that drive the FIXM development, identifies the planned release dates for FIXM core 
versions and verified extensions, and outlines the general and specific aims of each version. 

This document is developed and managed by the FIXM Change Control Board under the supervision 
of the ICAO ATMRPP, as stated in the FIXM Strategy [1] and FIXM Change Management Charter [2]

## General considerations about FIXM releases

As part of the lessons learned during the FIXM v4.0 development, the FIXM CCB acknowledged that 
FIXM  would  benefit  from  a  more  rigorous  and  timely  distribution  of  “beta  versions”  and  “release 
candidates”  enabling  the  FIXM  Community  of  Interest  to  check  the  quality  of  the  Change  Request 
implementation, to look for remaining bugs etc.  

The  FIXM  CCB  also  confirmed  the  value  of  face-to-face  FIXM  workshops  during  which  FIXM 
stakeholders  are  invited  to  review  and  challenge  preview  versions  and/or  share  implementation 
feedback. 

Starting  from 4.0.0 onwards, the development of new FIXM versions will include the publication of 
alpha, beta and release candidate versions, as described below: 
- Alpha version:  an  optional  version  of  FIXM  integrating  a  set  of  approved  changes  but  not 
necessarily  containing  all  of  the  content  or  design  changes  that  are  planned  for  the  final 
version. 
  - An  alpha  version  would  commonly  be  distributed  prior  to  a  FIXM  workshop  or  in 
support of other testing activities (E.g. OGC testbeds...), as needed. 
  - An  alpha  version  supporting  a  FIXM  workshop  would  be  released  at  least  4  weeks 
prior to the meeting. 
- Beta version: a version of FIXM being considered complete in terms of content, but not yet 
fully verified and tested and therefore likely to contain bugs. 
  - A  first  beta version  would commonly  be  distributed  at  the end of  the  FIXM  Change 
Requests integration, for further verification and testing by the FIXM community. 
  - As  a  good  practice,  the  first  beta  version  should  be  distributed  not  later  than  four 
months before the official planned released date of the FIXM. 
  - Additional beta versions may be released over time as bugs are being corrected. 
- Release  candidate:  a  beta  version  with  potential  to  be  a  final  product,  which  is  ready  to 
release unless significant bugs emerge.1 
  - As a good practice, the first release candidate should be published no later than two 
months before the planned official release date of the corresponding FIXM version.
